# A-Start
It will be the first repository i start in GIthub.
I am trying to recard this year's experience in learning data digit.
The first competetion i get in is CCF BDIC.
I decide to begin my Kaggler road,too.
Add it when my project gets expension.
The code now is uploaded,which is programed in ipython.
Otherwise,if it is hard to load the code in github
just turn to the site:"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FizzHerbert/A-Start/blob/master/"+the name of ipynb file
For example:https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FizzHerbert/A-Start/blob/master/KNN.ipynb can view the code in KNN.ipynb
